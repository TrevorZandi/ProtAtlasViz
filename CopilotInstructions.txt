I would like to build a Dash app with Plotly that generates visualizations of tissue selective gene expression between a set of genes. The data is derived from RNASeq data which is located in the data folder in this directory. Users should be able to select up to 10 genes and visualize the tissue distribution of these genes. The tissue should also be able to be grouped and consolidated by organ level, annotated based on the Histology_Dictionary.txt file included in the data folder. currently there is .venv folder.
